# MusicTheoryApp

Little playaround .net6 console app to fiddle around with, and learn about, music theory stuff.

When run, the app currently just prompts you for a note and provides you the notes of the major chord given that note is the root.

## Possible next steps:
- Testing
- Minor chords
- Extension chords
- Diminished, suspended, aug chords
- Given two notes, returns the interval
- Given more than two notes in a given sequence, returns the chord (non-contextual)
- Given a key, provides all the chords in that key
- Given a key as context and a note, provides the degree of that note
